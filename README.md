# Personal Website

This is my personal website hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Last.fm Integration

The website includes a Last.fm integration that displays my top albums from the last 3 months. This integration uses Last.fm's public API with a public API key that is safe to expose in client-side code. The API key can only:
- Access public data
- Make read-only requests
- Cannot modify any data
- Cannot access private user information
